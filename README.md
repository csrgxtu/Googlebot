<p><h3>Googlebot</h3> is a crawler implemented by Java, inspired by Google Inc and my formal<br />
project Google. it is used to crawl the WWW and store the orginal data into plain<br />
text files and some URL information into database.</p>

<p>I started this project because I found that is no handy open source crawler suits<br />
me, and by the same time, I had taken some time on Apache's Nutch, and it is really<br />
complicated to get to use. I am a student major in Math and Computer Science, so I<br />
need a a project to train or tune my skills.</p>

<p>Also, Googlebot will be the preproject of my later projects.</p>

<p>In a world, Google is a excellent Inc, Math and Computer Science is interesting,<br />
so, I want to get into it.</p>
