Googlebot is a crawler implemented by Java, inspired by Google Inc and my formal project Google. it is used to crawl the WWW and store the orginal data into plain text files and some URL information into database.

I started this project because I found that is no handy open source crawler suits me, and by the same time, I had taken some time on Apache's Nutch, and it is really complicated to get to use. I am a student major in Math and Computer Science, so I need a a project to train or tune my skills.

Also, Googlebot will be the preproject of my later projects.

In a world, Google is a excellent Inc, Math and Computer Science is interesting, so, I want to get into it.
